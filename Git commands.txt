git init - initialization of Repository
pwd - location git

git log --author="Bucky" - only Bucky's commits
git status - what's going on?
git diff - changes between Working file and Repository
git diff --staged - changes between Working file and Staging Area
git rm example.txt - remove example.txt file

to remane the file do next:
rename in branch
git add newfilename
git rm oldfilename
tha's it! Done =) 

OR:
git mv old.txt new.txt
that's easier

move and rename:
git mv old.txt newfolder/new.txt

git checkout -- filename.txt - restore a file from the Repository to working copy

git add . - sent to the staging area
